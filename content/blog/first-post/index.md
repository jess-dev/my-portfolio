I have just set this up, my new gatsby portfolio site where I will show off what I have done and attempt to regularly blog about tech and what I learn as a developer.
Please excuse my dust whilst building this site, it'll look amaze in a few weeks I promise (this blog post is obv date tagged so hows that for accountability!)
